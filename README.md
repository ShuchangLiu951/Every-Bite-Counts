This project explores how different foods affect blood sugar levels using real data from Dexcom glucose monitors. By combining food logs with continuous glucose readings, we built interactive visualizations to show how carbs, sugar, protein, and meal timing influence glucose spikes. Our findings highlight that protein-rich and earlier meals help keep blood sugar steady, while carb-heavy foods cause sharper spikes. Check out the visualizations to see how every bite counts!
